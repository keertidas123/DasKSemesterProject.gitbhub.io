  <!--This code is a paragraph tag that shows the decription of what my website is about-->
  <p class="ptext1">As much as we don't want to admit it, all of us as adults are growing up and straying further away
    from our childhood. But, we could all take some time to feel young again with no responsibilities. If you're in a
    tough spot in life, enjoy your adult freedom, as a child, with some of these tips.</p>

  <!--This code is the "Methods" section of my website which uses the h2 heading, an ordered list to number my different methods, having a specific image for each method, and a description of what each method is-->
  <section id="methods">
    <h2 class="headingtext">Easy Methods</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class="litext">Go to a playground</li>

      <img src="playground.jpg" width=350 class="picmargin" alt="playground">
      <p class="ptext">A playground is one of the best ways to play like a kid and also have some physical activity. If
        you don't believe me, go on a swing right now and push yourself as high as you can. When I go on the swings, I
        feel like I'm flying and back in my elementary school recess. It doesn't even have to be the swings, go down a
        slide and enjoy that moment of adventure with minimal effort. The important thing is to find something you enjoy
        and not take it too seriously.</p>

      <li class="litext">Rewatch your favorite childhood shows</li>

      <img src="childhoodshows.png" width=500 class="picmargin" alt="different childhood networks">
      <p class="ptext">Whether it's Disney, Nick, or Cartoon Network, watch a show that you loved as a kid. It seems
        like
        nothing but it can bring back such great memories. Sometimes, the shows can be cringy to watch as you've grown
        older but that makes it ten times better. It's interesting to question and laugh at the entertainment you
        consumed
        when you were a child. At the top of this page is a button to Disney+, a convenient website for rewatching old
        shows (Disney or other).</p>

      <li class="litext">Listen to your favorite old songs</li>

      <img src="oldmusic.jpg" width=300 class="picmargin" alt="cassette">
      <p class="ptext">If you don't have the attention span to rewatch a show, then listening to music is a great way to
        connect to your inner child. You're experiencing nostalgic feelings through sounds that you may not hear a lot
        nowadays. Easiest way to do this is by creating a playlist of your favorite childhood songs so you like every
        song
        that plays. Need some suggestions? Next to the Disney+ button is a "Nostalgia Playlist", which I created on
        Spotify.</p>
